# YAKP stands for Yet Another Kaamelott Page

This project was made with my ðŸ§  in sweat pants.

# url 

this has been deployed on surge for the fun of it, you can find it here: https://yakp.surge.sh

# stack 

html and css only because i wanted a small project in the form of a "back to basics" website. 

i decided not to use any flexbox or grid to center my divs.

# what i thought would happen

- struggling to center divs
- enjoying the result
- having fun coding and learning

# what actually happened

- definitely struggle to center divs without flex but successfully did it anyway
- doing css everyday at work definitely helped with some tricks here and there
- margin auto FTW
- i'm not sure if i'm doing this right but i'm enjoying the result 

# what i learned from this project

- that flexbox probably saved a lot of lives when it was first introduced 
- learned how to use fontawesome icons
- learned how to use and play with background images
- learned how to install and use an external font
